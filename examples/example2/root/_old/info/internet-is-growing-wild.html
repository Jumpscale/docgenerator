                            <p>Big majority of users in the world connect to servers not being present in their region and as
                                such experience higher cost &amp; low performance</p>
                            <p>According to a study of&nbsp;
                                <a href="http://www.datacentermap.com/">datacentermap.com</a>&nbsp;80% of the datacenters of internet service providers are based
                                in the US and Europe. The rest of the world has scarce resources dotted around territories.</p>
                            <p>As a consequence most internet users use internet based services running on infrastructure which
                                is located far away from their physical point of presence and most likely outside their country
                                borders. This decreases the general end user experience (latency) but also adds unnecessary
                                costs for actually transporting information back and forth and for enterprises it adds legislation
                                and compliance headaches.</p>

                                is influenced in a negative way by not having access to good, affordable internet services
                                keeping the status quo between the developed and less developed world. The United Nations

                            <p>Compute &amp; Storage vendors create poor performing solutions. There has been now year on year
                                improvements of hardware following&nbsp;
                                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s law</a>. While this has allowed ThreeFold to progress and innovate it has also lead
                                to software developers taking these advances for granted and cutting corners where they could
                                creating sub optimals code and allowing software components to be layered on top of each
                                other to achieve certain functionality of behavior.</p>
                            <p>The inefficiencies have now lead to a situation where organically grown IT architecture are immensely
                                complex and use a variety of components from different soft and hardware vendors integrates
                                by a so called integrator. The overall effort and cost involved to create, operate and maintain
                                such architectures is growing continuously and requiring an ever increasing budget and resourcing
                                to continue.</p>
                            <p>If it could go down to the core algorithms and take another looks at these, innovate at the heart
                                of technology instead of applying patches and pain killers we would be able to create a lot
                                more end user capacity that what systems provide today. The result of this is that systems
                                will last longer and do not have to be replaced by faster ones, it will take a lot less engineers
                                to create, operate and maintain these systems and overall they will present a more stable
                                and reliable platform achieving higher levels of uptime.</p>
                            <p>Only upsides, right? Well a huge downside of such an approach is that vendors will make less
                                revenue and more importantly less margin as system will run for longer, more stable and requires
                                less updates. Why would vendors innote at the core of their solution…….</p>

                            <p>Ten times more power efficiency can be achieved in e.g. storage systems</p>
                            <p>Today global Internet infrastructure requires enormous amounts of energy – well north of the
                                entire annual electricity consumption of the United Kingdom – ranking among the more pollutive
                                industries globally (similar to airlines!)</p>
                            <p>ThreeFold believes IT can do a lot better – in fact ThreeFold believes it can reduce the Internet’s
                                carbon footprint by 10 times compared to other industry standard IT capacity producing solutions.</p>
                            <p>Power consumption is a function of better compute and storage performance requiring more racks
                                and more cooling. The solutions achieve roughly 3 times the performance per rack (so it uses
                                fewer racks) – and the racks require less energy than typical racks in the industry 🙂</p>

                                documented IT infrastructures need an armada of people to keep it ticking. Find an example

                                presented in the example:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>On average an IT budget takes 5% of overall revenues</li>
                                <li>IT consumes 6.5% of the total number of FTE in the company of which 85% are insource and
                                    15% is on payroll. This means that the enterprise doesn’t retain internal know how how
                                    to operate their IT.</li>
                                <li>Just under 50% of the IT budget is spent on Infrastructure and operations and a similar amount
                                    is spent on Applications. A mere 5% is considered to be internal overhead within the
                                    IT department.</li>
                                <li>Around 65% of the IT budget is spend on resources and services, around 35% is spend on Hard
                                    and Software.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>These figures presents industry average number but they still paint a troubling picture that
                                the cost of IT are a sizeable part of an overall budget and most spend is going to have the
                                right knowledge skills insourced to the organisation to run the core IT architecture on which
                                the whole company operations rely – for any other discipline in any organisation this would
                                present an unacceptable risk to the business and it’s continuity – strangely not for IT.</p>

                            <p>20+ years ago when internet datacenters came into existence next to telecom points of presence
                                (POP’’) the level of complication in architecting, building and maintaining these infrastructures
                                exploded. From an already reasonable complicated technology setup to transport packets of
                                data around the globe these information warehouses were created where data was uploaded to,
                                processed and the obtained results send back to end users often many hundreds of kilometers
                                away.
                            </p>
                            <p>Managing a datacenter that contains solutions for transporting information, for storing information
                                and to process information is not an easy feat and the growth of data volume uploaded, stored
                                and processed has exponentially increased. The number of technologies invented and implemented
                                processing and storing this information has also exploded which as a combination results
                                in a double exponential growth in complexity to architect, build operate and maintain these.</p>
                            <p>The time has come that we refly on people not anymore to do the right thing in case of emergency
                                – the complexity is overwhelming and the dependency on this information being available is
                                huge. Manual deployments and operational responsibility by people is not providing the agility
                                and speed to keep up with the continuous exponential growth of the industry. It is time to
                                take the human element out of Information Technology and let smart systems take over.</p>
